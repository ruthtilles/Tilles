<h1> Siargao Tourist Spots</h1>
<p>Here are some of the most beautiful places to visit in Siargao Island. From relaxing places to thrilling ones, we’ve listed everything to help you create your Siargao itinerary.</p>

<h2> 1. Cloud 9 Siargao</h2>

<p> One of the most popular Siargao tourist spots is Cloud 9. This boardwalk is the perfect place to watch pro surfers and to see the sunset. Its three-story wooden pier lets you pick the best spot to get a view of the huge waves while feeling the cool breeze of the air as you wait for the sun to set. </p>

<h2> 2. Magpupungko Rock Pools</h2>

<p> Magpupungko Rock Pools is a great spot for cliff jumping, swimming, and exploring. From General Luna, where most of the tourist accommodations are, it’s just a 45-minute motorbike ride. Its formation is unbelievably beautiful but there is a catch though. Some days Magpupunko is closed to tourists so be sure to check before you make the trip there. And before going there, make sure what you prefer more because the area gives unique experiences during the low tide and high tide. If you’ve only got few days to spare on the island, be sure not to miss Magpupungko Rock Pools in your Siargao itinerary 3 days.</p>

<h2> 3. Naked Island</h2>

<p> Naked island, as the name suggests, is completely bare and has nothing but white sand and azure waters surrounding it, no distractions for the 360° view of the island. </p>

<h2> 4. Guyam Island</h2>

<p> If Naked Island is completely bare, Guyam island offers a lush clump of vegetation for tourists. It is secluded and uninhabited, except by the island’s caretakers, with a sandy beach on one side and a rocky beach on the other. This island covered in palm trees is small enough to walk around in just a few minutes. There are few huts available on the beach so you can just chill out and enjoy your solitude. </p>

<h2> 5. Daku Island </h2>

<p> Daku Island is mostly the place where tourists eat lunch during the island-hopping tour. You can indulge yourself in a sumptuous meal that includes the freshest seafood and refreshing buko (coconut) juice. Your local Siargao guide will help you find the best cook on the island. You can ask locals to cook fresh seafood and enjoy it on a boodle fight! And unlike the other two beaches mentioned, there are a lot more things to do in Daku Island from kayaking to fishing.</p>

<h2> 6. Sugba Lagoon</h2>

<p> Sugba Lagoon is a famous Siargao diving spot because of its great view and turquoise waters. While it’s one of the famous diving spots in the Philippines, tourists can also enjoy snorkeling, paddle boarding, or just picture-taking for those with fear of heights. Whatever the case is, Sugba Lagoon is a great place to be!</p>

<h2> 7. Maasin River </h2>
