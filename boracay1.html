<h1> How to Get to Boracay </h1>
<p> Boracay is accessible from the major cities of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao – three primary island groups of the Philippine archipelago.  </p>

<p>Before traveling to Boracay, make sure you have a printed voucher from your pre-booked accredited Boracay resorts and hotels. You will be denied entry to the island if you don’t hold a voucher from your resort or hotel. It is part of the new rules that the local government and tourism office is implementing since Boracay opened to the public after the rehabilitation program in 2018.</p>

<h2> Going to Caticlan Jetty Port</h2>
<p> The main jump-off point is Caticlan Jetty Port, but there are different ways to get there. Here are four transport options when traveling to Caticlan Jetty Port:</p>

<h3> By Air </h3>
<p> It is the fastest route when going to Boracay. It is also the most accessible since flights are coming from different parts of the Philippines and even several countries outside the Philippines.</p>

<p>If you’re coming from Manila, the capital of the Philippines located in Luzon, take a 1-hour domestic flight from the Ninoy Aquino International Airport to Caticlan. Flying in from Clark to Boracay via Caticlan is also an option if you’re coming from the Northern part of Luzon or if you want to avoid the traffic in Manila. Airfares from Clark are usually lower than Manila.</p>

<p>If you’re coming from the Visayas, there are direct flights to Caticlan from Cebu City’s Mactan International Airport. If you’re coming from Mindanao, there are direct flights from Davao Francisco Bangoy International Airport to Caticlan. From Caticlan Airport, take a 10-15 minute tricycle ride going to Caticlan Jetty Port. </p>

<h3> By Ferry </h3>
<p> Most locals ride a ferry going to Boracay as it's much cheaper. If you don't mind traveling for long hours or a couple of days, then you might try this mode of transportation. Take note that the main port for Boracay is Caticlan Jetty Port. Below are some of the best ways to go to this port to the island.</p>

<h3> Kalibo Airport </h3>
<p>A flight to Kalibo in Aklan, a more significant island near Boracay, is significantly cheaper than a direct flight to Caticlan. However, you will need to travel for 2 hours from Kalibo Airport to Caticlan Jetty Port.</p>
<p>When you land at the Kalibo Airport, you will find a multitude of transportation options that will take you to the Caticlan Jetty Port. Be sure to check whether it’s cost-effective or if it will be more expensive for you. Your land travel options to Caticlan include riding a bus or van.  </p>

<h3> By Bus from Manila and Board a RoRo </h3>
<p> Several bus companies are maintaining the Manila-Caticlan route. You can hop on a bus from either the Cubao or Pasay terminal. Your total travel time for this route is approximately 13 hours, excluding the boarding time between trips.</h3>
