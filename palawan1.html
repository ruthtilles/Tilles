<h1> Palawan Travel and Transport</h1>
<p>The Philippines isn’t the easiest place to get around, and it often takes a full day to get from A to B. Plan your time accordingly.</p>

<p>Most international and domestic flights go via Manila or Cebu, so you’ll often need to take a connecting flight, and overland transfers can be slow. A hassle when you’re travelling, but it does mean that the stunning Philippines islands are less crowded than most Asian beach hotspots. </p> 

<h2> How to get to Palawan?</h2>
<p>In Palawan, most people fly into Puerto Princesa, where there’s regular flights from Manila and Cebu. You can also fly direct from Manila to El Nido and Coron to get your island-hopping on without an overland transfer. Expect to pay more for these flights in exchange for saving a good few hours in a van.</p>

<h2> How to get around Palawan?</h2>
<p> Local transport around the towns is the tricycle, the Filipino version of a tuk tuk. Tricycles are cheap, easy and convenient. However, they’re not as comfortable as some other tuk tuks as it’s a tight squeeze to fit two people in and the roads are bumpy.</p>

<h1> Palawan Travel Accommodation</h1>
<p>Palawan accommodation ranges from backpacker hostels to boutique guesthouses to luxury private island resorts, and everything in between. Whatever your budget, you’ll find something to suit in Palawan.</p>
 <h3>1. El Nido Accommodation </h3>
 <p>You can spend four nights at The Birdhouse El Nido, unique glamping tents perched on a cliff above the lovely Marimegmeg Beach. The tents have all the creature comforts you need, with decent beds, bathrooms and, best of all, balconies with out of this world views of the bay below.</p>
 <p>Marimegmeg Beach is the nicer of the mainland beaches and has some chilled beach bars to laze the day away at. </p>

 <h3>2. Port Barton Accommodation</h3>
 <p>You can spend four nights at Secret Paradise Resort & Turtle Sanctuary, a small resort on a private island which has to be up there with the most beautiful places I’ve ever visited. Big call, I know, but I’m throwing it out there.</p>

<p>If you can cope with pretty average food and service, then I definitely recommend Secret Paradise Resort for the stunning location, tranquility, snorkeling and chance to see turtles laying or hatching on the beach.</p>

<h1> Palawan Climate + Best Time to Visit Palawan</h1>
<h2> Palawan Dry Season</h2>
<p> Palawan travel is best during the dry season from November to May.</p>

<p>From November, the rains ease off, but don’t completely disappear, and it can rain at any time during the dry season.
December to February is the cool dry season. March to May is the hot dry season, with humidity peaking in hottest months of April and May.
Weather wise, the very best months for Palawan travel are during the drier and relatively cooler months of February and March.
If you’re a diver, water visibility is said to be best from March to May. As a bonus, the ocean is also the calmest during this time.</p>

<h1> Palawan Rainy Season</h1>
<p>The rainy season starts in earnest from June and continues until around November. During this time, there can be heavy monsoon rains, rough seas and muddy roads. All of this can put a slight damper on a tropical beach holiday, or even stop Palawan travel altogether if you encounter a severe tropical storm.</p>
