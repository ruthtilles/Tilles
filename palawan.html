<h2> EXPLORE.</h2>

<p> Get your sun-kissed adventure in the islands and beaches of El Nido, Palawan. </p>

<h1> Why visit Palawan?</h1>
<p> Palawan Island is a tropical paradise, with hands-down the best beaches I’ve been to in Southeast Asia. (In fact, second in broader Asia to the beautiful Maldives!) The ocean is all imaginable shades of turquoise, the beaches are sandy white, and the aquatic life is vibrant.

It’s therefore not surprising that Palawan was voted the World’s Best Island by Travel & Leisure in 2015 and 2016. It also received similar accolades from Conde Nast and National Geographic. A beach bum’s dream destination!</p>

<h1>Where to Go in Palawan + Palawan Activities</h1>
<p>Palawan travel is all about the tropical beaches and island hopping! We visited El Nido and Port Barton, and spent our time island hopping, kayaking, snorkeling, chilling at beach bars, reading and patting beach dogs (always a favorite holiday activity). Highlights were the beautiful clear water and the snorkeling, where we saw lots of tropical fish and a few turtles.</p><br>

<h2> 1. El Nido and Coron Island-Hopping</h2>
<p>For island-hopping, the most popular Palawan travel destinations are El Nido and Coron, and for good reason. So which one is best?

Coron is considered better for divers and is more laidback.

El Nido has incredible lagoons and more nightlife.

However, Coron and El Nido both have beautiful islands and excellent snorkeling. If you can’t fit in both, choose one and you’ll be guaranteed to have an incredible holiday.</p>

<h2> 2. Port Barton for Laid Back Beach Vibes</h2>
<p>If El Nido’s all too busy for you, then Port Barton may just be the answer. Port Barton is a sleepy fishing village on a quiet beach, with a laid back vibe and rustic accommodation. Even better, Port Barton opens up to beautiful islands and bays to rival El Nido. <p>
<p>As well as island hopping, Port Barton has a couple of short hikes to lush waterfalls with swimming holes. These are well worth the trip for a change of scenery.</p>

<h2> 3. Puerto Princesa Underground River</h2>
<p> Other than island hopping, the main attraction in Palawan is the Puerto Princesa Underground River. The Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Here, you can travel by boat through the world’s longest navigable underground river through a network of limestone caves.

<p>The underground river is around 80km from Puerto Princesa. You can easily visit on a day trip from Puerto Princesa or even en route to Port Barton or El Nido.</p>

<p>With its limestone karst landscape and otherworldly atmosphere, it’s easy to see why the underground river is one of the most popular attractions in Palawan. However, as with any tourist hotspot, this inevitably comes with packaged tour pitfalls and plenty of crowds.</p>
