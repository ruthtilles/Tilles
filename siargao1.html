<p> Unlike other destinations, Siargao doesn’t really have a distinct local cuisine or delicacy except for Sayongsong. It is a color violet puto (Filipino rice cake) wrapped in banana leaves. This yummy snack is made from glutinous rice, brown sugar, roasted peanuts, calamansi juice, and coconut milk. You can buy sayongsong at the local public markets around Siargao.</p>

<p>But just because Siargao doesn’t have its own delicacy, that doesn’t also mean that you wouldn’t enjoy food tripping on the island! In fact, there are so many restaurants where you can eat the most filling and delicious food you didn’t know that exist in an island like the pugon-baked pizza of Kermit, affordable grilled foods at Mama’s grill,  yummy desserts at Halika Artisan Gelato Coffee & Juices, and the best island smoothie bowls of Shaka Cafe. </p>
